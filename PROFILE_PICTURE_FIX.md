# Profile Picture and Likes Implementation - Deployment Fix

This document explains how we fixed the deployment issues with the profile picture feature.

## Problem

The profile picture feature was working locally but failed in production with these errors:

1. **Missing Database Columns**: The `profilePicture` and `likesCount` columns were missing in the production database.
2. **Error Handling**: The controllers didn't gracefully handle the case when these columns didn't exist.

## Solution

We implemented a four-part solution:

### 1. Created SQL Migration Script

We created a direct SQL migration script to add the missing columns:
- `backend/prisma/migrations/migration_manual_profile_updates.sql`

### 2. Updated Deploy Script

We modified `deploy.sh` to:
- Check for the existence of DATABASE_URL
- Execute direct SQL commands to add missing columns before running Prisma migrations
- Create the ProfileLike table if it doesn't exist
- Add proper foreign key constraints

### 3. Made Controllers More Resilient

We updated controllers to handle cases where columns might be missing:
- `profileController.js` - Added fallback values and better error handling
- `likesController.js` - Added specific error handling for P2022 (column not found) errors

### 4. Improved Response Handling

- Changed from using `next(err)` to explicitly returning error responses
- Added better error messages to help with debugging
- Added fallback values for all potentially missing fields

## How to Deploy

The fix will be applied automatically on the next deployment as it's built into the `deploy.sh` script. No manual steps are needed.

## Testing

After deployment, the application should:
1. Successfully load profile data
2. Show profile pictures where available
3. Allow profile image upload
4. Show "first letter" avatars as fallbacks when no profile picture exists
5. Display and track likes properly

## Future Improvements

For a more robust solution in the future:
1. Use proper Prisma migrations for all schema changes
2. Add more comprehensive error handling
3. Consider a dedicated image storage solution instead of ImgBB
